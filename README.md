# IntelligentSpaceAPI - Junction 2021

This repository contains the frontend code for HomeSecure and FluidOffice - our two examples for practical applications for the IntelligentSpaceAPI. The repository for the API can be found from GitHub (https://github.com/Trinode-Software/Junction2021API).

The applications can be found from the following:
 - HomeSecure (https://homesecuritydemo.web.app/)
 - FluidOffice (https://fluidoffice.web.app/)
 
 Please give the software some time since it is somewhat cpu-hungry and hosted by a potato.
